### Description
KCFinder is free open-source replacement of CKFinder web file manager. It can be integrated into FCKeditor, CKEditor, and TinyMCE WYSIWYG web editors (or your custom web applications) to upload and manage images, flash movies, and other files that can be embedded in an editor's generated HTML content.

The original repo [KCFinder](http://kcfinder.sunhater.com/) did not comply with [psr-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) specifications so I alter the structure and naming concentions of the original. This is the repo now follows said specs and is ready for install via composer.
